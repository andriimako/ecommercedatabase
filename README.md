# The e-commerce website database 

About the service

It should be a simple e-commerce website where people can buy different kinds of products. 
We need to know what products are available and can be bought. 
The purchase can be made both by a registered and guest user. 
We should keep the information about the shipping address, purchase history. We need to know the user’s birthday and discount if one has any. 
In our store, each individual product may have its specific discount, as well as each registered customer, may have their discount.

●	the customer information (name, surname, email, shipping, phone number)
